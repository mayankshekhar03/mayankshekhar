Since Windows is designed to work on PCs of various configurations and manufacturers, sometimes it becomes an issue to resolve any problem that is encountered because there are many possible reasons why that issue might have occurred in the first place. It doesn’t mean that Windows is an unusable operating system, rather it simply means that there are trade-offs in between universal compatibility and compatibility issues.

But these issues get resolved very easily and are not that hard to get rid of. On the contrary, this is the reason why Windows is still popular because it is versatile and provides loads of features.  Normally whenever an issue occurs it is better to show it to an expert rather than experimenting with your system by yourself but there are some techniques which sometimes come in handy if you want to fix a problem without harming your system.

#### Restart your system

Don’t underestimate the power of a simple restart. A restart can be very powerful in fixing any problem that you might face using a Windows system. A restart can remove temporary files that get created during installation of a program. A restart can also be useful in installation of an important update that might be pending for weeks.

So, in simple words whenever you face any problem restart!

#### Update drivers

The manufacturer of the system that you are owning always has a dedicated website for a list of drivers that your system requires so don’t forget to check for latest drivers for your system every once in a year and when you face some issue.

<blockquote>In my case, whenever I used to login into my system, the pointer would get stuck after 5-10 secs on the desktop screen. It was frustrating and not acceptable. Then I happen to stumble upon the Lenovo website of my laptop where drivers were listed. I installed the Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver and now my laptop runs buttery smooth.</blockquote>

#### Search for Virus

Sometimes the problems that you face are the outcomes of some program which was created with evil intentions and somehow that program made its way to your computer. Let me inform you that most of the Anti Virus programs are good at prevention but if a virus gets activated in your system then it becomes tough after that.

Despite the above fact just install a free Anti Virus program and scan the whole system and see if that does the trick.

#### Reset Windows

When all the above techniques don’t work then take a backup of your important stuff in the system and reset your Windows. The option is available in Settings.
