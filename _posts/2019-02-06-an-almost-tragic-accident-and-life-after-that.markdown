<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span> vividly remember the day when that incident happened. It was such a beautiful morning. I live in north India and temperature here during summers reaches around 45 degrees (Celsius). Autumn was just around the corner and it was soothing weather outside. It was like heaven for us, north Indians.</p>

Every morning I would hit the road with my scooter towards my college where I used to study. That day was no different. The first few minutes were just normal, I was driving, what I was supposed to do or maybe I have forgotten the things that happened to me earlier that day because they got overshadowed by what was about to happen next.

Anyway, in between the journey towards my college, I don’t know why but I started to appreciate the change in the weather. I was in awe with the beauty all around me because of the pleasant weather.

But, little did I know what was about to happen next. I hope you won’t laugh after reading this but there was a bee in my helmet and the thing is that I am hell scared of bees. Here’s a fun fact, I have never experienced how it feels like to be stung by a bee, even today. So, as soon as I saw the bee sitting in front of my eyes, I got scared and fell down my scooter. I was on the road with my scooter around 2 feet away from me. I looked around my body and saw pants were ripped a little other than that I saw no other signs of damage! I actually thought I could still make it to my college (there was a class test that day, perfect isn’t it).

All of a sudden I saw people started coming towards me to help me with the situation I was in. I tried to stand up on my own but to my surprise, I wasn’t able to stand up, no matter how hard I tried. Later, one of the persons around me came and gave me his helping hand. When I stood up with the help, I noticed that my right hand was just hanging there like a hanger. I wasn’t able to move it on my own. It was then when I realized that I was in some deep mess. Many thoughts were going through my mind. “Am I hand crippled?”, “Why would I drive a scooter for such a long distance?”, “Am I sacrificing a lot for my under-graduation?”, “Should I leave college?”. Ahh!

“Why can’t I feel pain?”

The helpful people asked me to give contacts of anyone who knows me. I gave them the phone number of my mother and close friend. My friend was going through that route so he came early and college arranged an ambulance and took me to the government hospital. They gave me first aid and my mother reached by then. She was very emotional. I could see from her eyes. I was moved to a different hospital where they informed that damages were severe but recovery was possible (the joint of my elbow was completely crushed). They applied POP so I couldn’t move my hand. After a few days, I had my surgery and then again POP was applied. The POP was kept for about a month, I don’t exactly remember. When the POP was removed I couldn’t move my hand. They recommended physiotherapy, there I went for around one month. The first week was very tough. Sometimes I used to think if I would ever recover or not. But eventually, I recovered.

Today it’s almost 3 years. I can use my right hand properly now. Although it would never be as it was before the accident but still I can do almost everything that I could do before. I successfully graduated from college and now I have a job too.

If you are going through the same then don’t worry it gets better.
